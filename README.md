Battleships
===========

Each player has a grid of 10x10

Each player has 5 ships of various lengths

Each player puts the ships on their grid.

Each player takes it in turns to guess if a square on their opponents grid is occupied.

The player can see where he palced the shot on his opponents grid and, if it struck a ship, the type of ship it was.

The first player to sink all of his opponents ships wins.
